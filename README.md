# Python Course for Data Science
In this course we’re going to cover the fundamental topics of the Python programming language. After completing all you’ll be able to start writing your very own Python programs. Based on recent surveys, Python was and still is the most popular, high-level, open-source programming language! It is a powerful, fast and dynamic programming language that runs everywhere. It’s also interactive, object-oriented, and very easy to learn. Anyone can create programs with it. It’s particularly great for web development, and scientific computing. With its vast libraries, it’s also useful for data visualization and data analytics.
